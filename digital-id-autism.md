# Digital IDs and Autism: Why the UK's Digital ID System Must Be Inclusive

The UK government’s push for a national digital ID system has sparked significant debate across technology, policy, and civil rights communities. While supporters highlight potential benefits—such as streamlining services, reducing fraud, and improving government efficiency—there is a pressing need to consider the diverse and often overlooked impact on vulnerable groups. One group that stands to be particularly affected is autistic people.

As an autistic person myself, I find the prospect of a mandatory digital ID deeply worrying. I work with data professionally, so I understand the logic behind centralised systems and the appeal of efficiency. Yet despite this, I experience significant stress when using mobile phones in public, and the idea of having to rely on a digital identity—especially one tied to biometric data—creates anxiety rather than reassurance. My experience is far from unique, and it highlights why accessibility and inclusion must be at the heart of any national digital ID strategy.

While digital IDs have the potential to transform how we interact with government services and private companies, their implementation must be approached with care. Autistic people often face unique challenges when navigating digital, bureaucratic, or high‑pressure systems. Without thoughtful design, a digital ID system could unintentionally marginalise those who already face barriers to access.

## The Promised Benefits of Digital IDs

Digital IDs have been presented as a solution to several long‑standing issues. The UK government argues that they can:

- Streamline services, making it easier for citizens to access healthcare, benefits, tax records, and other public services.  
- Combat illegal immigration by ensuring that only those with verified legal status can access employment and services.  
- Improve security and reduce fraud, with biometric data offering a more secure and tamper‑resistant method of verifying identity.  
- Create efficiencies across government and private services through a “once only” approach, where verified data is reused across multiple platforms without repeated documentation.

These arguments are compelling, and in an ideal world, digital IDs could make everyday life smoother for many people. However, as with any major technological shift, the potential drawbacks must be carefully considered before full implementation.

## Why Digital IDs Could Pose Challenges for Autistic People

Digital IDs may appear to be a step forward, but they also carry significant risks. For autistic people, these risks can go far beyond inconvenience—they can affect access to essential services, employment, independence, and social inclusion.

### 1. Cognitive Load and System Complexity

Autistic people often experience heightened difficulty with systems that are complex, unfamiliar, or require navigating multiple steps under pressure. A national digital ID system could add significant cognitive load, particularly if obtaining, maintaining, or using the ID becomes confusing or stressful.

Those who struggle with executive functioning may find it difficult to keep track of documentation, manage updates, or troubleshoot technical issues. For many autistic people—including myself—unexpected glitches or system errors can be overwhelming. The fear of being locked out of essential services due to a technical problem is not hypothetical; it is a very real concern.

### 2. Sensory Sensitivities and Biometric Data

Biometric authentication—such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning—is likely to be central to any digital ID system. While these technologies can improve security, they also present challenges for autistic people with sensory sensitivities.

Facial recognition may feel intrusive or uncomfortable, especially in public spaces. Fingerprint scanners can be distressing for those who dislike certain tactile sensations. Moreover, biometric systems often fail to account for natural human variation, including:

- atypical facial expressions  
- differences in eye contact  
- changes in appearance during sensory overload or anxiety  

If the system cannot reliably capture or recognise an autistic person’s biometric data, the result could be misidentification, delays, or exclusion.

### 3. Risk of Misinterpretation and Algorithmic Bias

Autistic behaviour is often misunderstood by humans—and even more so by automated systems. AI‑driven identity checks may misinterpret:

- reduced eye contact  
- atypical speech patterns  
- stimming  
- heightened anxiety in unfamiliar environments  

as suspicious or non‑compliant behaviour. Without human oversight, autistic people could be unfairly flagged for additional scrutiny or denied access to services.

### 4. Digital Exclusion

The digital divide affects many groups, but it has a unique impact on autistic people. Some autistic individuals—particularly those who are non‑verbal or who struggle with complex interfaces—may find digital‑only systems inaccessible.

Even for those who are technically skilled, using mobile devices in public can be stressful or overwhelming. I experience this myself: despite working with data every day, I find it difficult to use my phone confidently in busy or unpredictable environments. A system that assumes constant digital competence risks excluding people like me.

### 5. The Psychological Burden of a “Single Identity”

For autistic people who rely on routine and predictability, the idea of a single digital identity acting as a gateway to essential services can be deeply unsettling. A single point of failure—whether caused by a technical error, a biometric mismatch, or a lost device—could disrupt access to healthcare, employment, or financial support.

This creates a sense of vulnerability rather than empowerment.

## The Need for Inclusive Design

If the UK’s digital ID system is to be effective and equitable, it must be designed with the needs of all citizens in mind—especially those who are most vulnerable. For autistic people, this means:

- **Providing non‑digital alternatives** for those who struggle with technology or biometric authentication.  
- **Ensuring human intervention is always available** when automated systems flag errors or discrepancies.  
- **Designing interfaces that accommodate sensory sensitivities and diverse cognitive styles.**  
- **Offering clear, accessible, and rapid error‑correction processes** that do not rely solely on digital channels.  

Inclusive design is not an optional extra—it is essential for fairness, accessibility, and public trust.

## Conclusion: A Digital ID System for Everyone

A national digital ID system presents both opportunities and risks. While it may increase efficiency and streamline access to services, it is crucial that the voices of marginalised groups—such as autistic people—are included in the design process.

The benefits of digital IDs must not come at the cost of increased exclusion, stress, or anxiety for those already disadvantaged by complex systems. As we move towards a digital future, the challenge is not simply to build systems that work for the majority, but systems that work for everyone.

The UK government has a responsibility to ensure that its digital ID system is secure, inclusive, and accessible, enabling all citizens to participate in society without fear of discrimination or exclusion. Only through thoughtful, human centred design can we ensure that no one is left behind.
